-FOUND KEYS!!!!

-track down lake change lady-done ish
-contact mark re: soil samples-done
-ben: elemental analyses-done
-dana: soil balance/lter stuff-done
-photocopy abstract, return to eugenie-done

-come up with questions for ESA stuff
-gmw fellowship app
-get some preliminary data in.

	enter tree and shrub data
	compare pca to lake area? to lake change estimates?
	what about species richness data?
	compare soil moisture to other lake variables, to plant community structure
	come up with list of parameter estimates
	Friday = start some soil samples drying, put in oven. 
	
	tonight- get sponsor, abstract stuff sorted out. Outline budget needs, look over methods
		   - paper comments starting at 7pm.
	maybe get what's his name working on entering species richness data.
	get him started sorting tem samples first, naturally.- there are fewer of them anyway.

look at list of 12 vital signs, pitch towards that.-done

0_9_1, 0_9_2, 1_58_1, 0_2_1, and 0_2_2.. also 1_27_1 from last year?

brad questions
- show abstract-okay
- ask about buying balance
- seminar series
- yfnwr liason-done
- pitching app to sound like something parks would want.
- goals for data collection

- need preliminary data- get tree and shrub densities for those sites
					   - get species richness data
					   - hab structure data
					   - model hab stuff as response to lake characteristics
					   - model species data as a function of hab zone width or pca.
					   
					   - put together some kind of pretty plot of the study area- easy.
					   -identify some stable/fluctuating lakes to compare.
