vegan.r ordination notes

vegan also has packages for biodiversity analyses including species accumulation curves.

to look up: 
NMDS

cluster analysis:

function decorana()

pca:

use vegdist to calc vegetation dissimilarity indices

also separate out using machine learning algorithims- tree cutoffs?
	
vegan- metaMDS- converge on nmds solution using multiple random starts

envfit- fit environmental vectors to nmds gradients

ordisurf- fit surfaces of environmental variables to ordination
- could do this for species richness?


cca- canonical correspondence analysis

pca done in func rda package vegan

also princomp package stats

varespec- pctcover data for species

so you could make a table of mean habitat widths for all habs and all lakes
 same for species presence/absence
