Overview
The dominating North face of Mount Baring is the most dramatic sight in this sector of the Cascades and maybe one of the most powerful in the cascades. It`s vertical and overhanging face is readily noticable as one drives up US Hwy 2 towards Stevens Pass. Even though it is not high by Cascade standards, it`s relief of over 5,000 ft above the Skykomish river gives it a commanding presense. The peak has technical routes to offer as well as a class 3 scramble. The imposing north face was a climb that took much effort from several different parties, and even one fatality, over a span of ten years before the first asscent was finally completed.

				
Getting There
Drive US Hwy 2 East of Index to the small town of Baring and turn North on road 6024. Cross the railroad tracks and follow the gravel road 4 1/2 miles to the trailhead for Barkley lake. Do not take the trail to the lake but instead continue up the abandoned road until a creek crossing and a cairn and find the climbers path heading up next to the creek.
